# Random-Python-codes
I believe,  in these codes I'm sharing, there are quite interesting ideas from the programming world. And this should help those who want to start learning to program. 

Bellow, there is a small description of the codes here posted:

MC_Integral -> Monte Carlo method to calculate definite integrals.

Recursion_fibonacci -> Two forms of recursion programming, in which you can easily see the costing difference from both. The first one is very simple to write and understand but it's immensely time-costing. The second is way faster but it uses your computer's memory (on more complex problems, you need to know if the memory cost is worth the shot).

Try to wait for the 40th number of the sequence using both methods and you'll see the startling difference.

VectorOp -> Very simple vector operations. This may help those who are starting to write object oriented codes.
